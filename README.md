# SCOT: Set Cover Optimal Teaching
> Set Cover Optimal Teaching for Sequential Decision Making with Inverse Reinforcement Learning

In this repository we recreate the SCOT machine teaching algorithm for custom grid environments, robust to stochastic environments with arbitrary numbers of 'colored' squares (features).

## Usage
Install dependencies with Python3
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
To run initial test cases, including those outlined in (Brown and Niekum, 2019), run
```
python3 main.py
```
> See `algorithms` folder for all our reinforcement learning algorithms.
